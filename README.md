# Weather Monitoring System

## Project Overview
The Weather Monitoring System is a real-time data processing application that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The system processes this data to provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates and visualizes the data for easier comprehension.

## Features
- Real-time weather data retrieval for major Indian metros.
- Temperature conversion from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Daily weather summaries including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions.
- User-configurable thresholds for alerts based on temperature.
- Visualizations using Chart.js.


## Dependencies

- **Express:** For building the backend server.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Chart.js** For creating visualizations.
- **Mocha & Chai:** For testing.
